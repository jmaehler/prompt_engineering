Certainly! Here's a recipe for a delicious French-style fruity and creamy tart without gelatin or corn starch:

Fruit and Cream Tart

Ingredients:

For the Tart Crust:

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon cold water
For the Cream Filling:

1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 oz mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
For the Fruit Topping:

Assorted fresh fruits (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, kiwi, or peaches), sliced or chopped as desired
1/4 cup apricot preserves or fruit jelly, for glazing
Instructions:

Prepare the Tart Crust:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and sugar. Add the cold cubed butter.
Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cold water. Pour this mixture into the flour mixture and gently knead until the dough comes together.
Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Roll Out and Bake the Crust:

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a circle slightly larger than your tart pan.
Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan.
Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.
Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until it is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.
Prepare the Cream Filling:

In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
Add the room temperature mascarpone cheese to the whipped cream mixture and gently fold it in until smooth and well combined.
Assemble the Tart:

Once the tart crust has cooled completely, spread the cream filling evenly over the bottom of the crust.
Arrange the Fruit Topping:

Arrange the sliced or chopped fresh fruits on top of the cream filling in an attractive pattern.
Glaze the Fruit:

In a small saucepan, heat the apricot preserves or fruit jelly over low heat until melted.
Brush the melted preserves or jelly over the arranged fruit to give it a glossy finish.
Chill and Serve:

Refrigerate the tart for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the filling to set.
Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy your delightful French-style fruit and cream tart!
This tart is not only visually appealing but also bursting with fruity flavors and creamy goodness, making it a perfect dessert for any occasion. Bon appétit!
